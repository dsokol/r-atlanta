Good news everyone! We're taking [your suggestions](/r/Atlanta/comments/wi3gw/what_belongs_in_the_ratlanta_faq/) on what to put in the FAQ, and you can add your own right now in [TrueFAQ](/r/atlanta/w/truefaq). So please [suggest things!](/r/Atlanta/comments/wi3gw/what_belongs_in_the_ratlanta_faq/)

To start, we have a few rules, they are as follows:  

**Rules**

* **SITEWIDE [RULES](/rules)**
  * Don't [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F).
  * Don't ask for votes or engage in [vote manipulation](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_vote_cheating_and_vote_manipulation.3F).
  * Don't post [personal information](/wiki/faq#wiki_is_posting_personal_information_ok.3F).
  * No [child pornography](http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?PageId=1504) or [sexually suggestive content featuring minors](/r/blog/comments/pmj7f/a_necessary_change_in_policy/).
  * Don't break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of the site.
* **r/Atlanta rules**
   * Don't be a mean or contemptible person.
   * No personal attacks.
   * RE: Rule 3: See [Missing Persons](/r/missingpersons/about/sidebar).

   * Jobs go here: /r/atljobs
   * Don't use URL shorteners (tinyurl, etc), your post will be spammed. We can't help this.

**How do I make sure to be notified of reddit meetups?**

Search r/atlanta for the word 'meetup' every week or so. Sometimes there are spur-of-the-moment meetups that happen that night, and we hope that people organizing such flash meets post also on our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/atlantaredditors) to increase awareness.  If you use an RSS reader to subscribe to r/atlanta, this will help.  There is also a facebook group for that kind of thing.

**I'm new here. Where should I go out to eat/drink/do things?**

Everyone's got different opinions on this, so don't take the recommendations of others as a guarantee of enjoyment. The only perfect food item is the Salmon Scramble at the Flying Biscuit, and even those vary by location.

**I'm sober. How do I resolve this?**

I read recently that there's some crazy ratio like 1:5 of bars:people in Atlanta. Never be sober again with [k1ana's thread](/r/Atlanta/comments/iobk4/).

**I'm in downtown and need to park!**

PARK ALREADY! http://www.atlantadowntown.com/guide/getting-around/parking

**I'm an expert on Atlanta.  How do I help?**

Write up your thoughts, look at ArkadyF's guide above if you want a good example. Feel free to either post suggestions in the appropriate thread or make your own. Whatev's. Feel free to add your own, again, to [TrueFAQ](/r/atlanta/w/truefaq)

**How do I request a Neighborhood Name (flair) next to my user name on posts?**

First, Subscribe to /r/Atlanta.  Next, check the box that says "Show my flair on this Reddit" .  Last, Edit what you want your flair to say.
