Good news everyone! We're taking [your suggestions](/r/Atlanta/comments/wi3gw/what_belongs_in_the_ratlanta_faq/) on what to put in the FAQ, and you can add your own right now in [TrueFAQ](/r/atlanta/w/truefaq). So please [suggest things!](/r/Atlanta/comments/wi3gw/what_belongs_in_the_ratlanta_faq/)

**How do I make sure to be notified of reddit meetups?**

Search r/atlanta for the word 'meetup' every week or so. Sometimes there are spur-of-the-moment meetups that happen that night, and we hope that people organizing such flash meets post also on our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/atlantaredditors) to increase awareness.  If you use an RSS reader to subscribe to r/atlanta, this will help.

**I'm new here. Where should I go out to eat/drink/do things?**

Everyone's got different opinions on this, so don't take the recommendations of others as a guarantee of enjoyment. The only perfect food item is the Salmon Scramble at the Flying Biscuit, and even those vary by location.
